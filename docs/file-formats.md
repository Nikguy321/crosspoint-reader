# File Formats

These formats describe the SD-card cache files under `/.crosspoint/epub_<hash>/`.
All POD fields are written in the ESP32 little-endian representation used by
`Serialization.h`; strings are length-prefixed UTF-8.

## `book.bin`

### Version 10

`book.bin` stores EPUB metadata plus lookup tables for spine and TOC entries.
The current firmware writes this version from `BookMetadataCache`.

ImHex pattern:

```c++

## `section.bin`

### Version 48

Version 48 keeps the version 47 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because Hangul text no longer has implicit line-break opportunities between
syllables: Korean words wrap at spaces (like CSS `word-break: keep-all`), and
with hyphenation enabled a word may also split at the end of a line wherever the
CJK line-breaking rules allow, without an inserted hyphen. Justification stretches only word spaces. Cached line breaks and word
positions from version 47 no longer match.

### Version 47

The section header adds signed `characterSpacing` (pixels) and unsigned
`wordSpacingPercent` after `focusReadingEnabled`; both participate in cache
validation. Each TextBlock's BlockStyle stores only `characterSpacing` after
`directionDefined`. Word spacing is resolved into cached word positions during
layout. Sections from earlier versions are rebuilt.

### Version 46

Version 46 keeps the version 45 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ordered lists now number their items, `list-style-type: none`
suppresses list markers, and `<ul>`/`<ol>` containers contribute their own
margins and padding to child block insets, changing cached word contents and
page layout.

### Version 45

Version 45 keeps the version 44 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because internal EPUB links now preserve CSS superscript and subscript styles,
changing their cached word-style flags and page layout.

### Version 44

Each file in `sections/*.bin` stores one laid-out spine section. The header is
also the cache-busting key: if any layout-affecting setting differs from the
current reader settings, the section is discarded and rebuilt.

Version 44 appends the internal-link rectangles produced during text layout to
each serialized page. The reader uses these rectangles for touch navigation;
older caches are rebuilt because they contain no link geometry.

Version 43 keeps the version 42 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because paragraph base direction now excludes direction changes from inline
elements.

Version 42 keeps the version 41 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because closing a block now strips inherited vertical margins and padding.

Version 41 keeps the version 40 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because simple HTML table rows are now laid out as positioned columns rather
than flattened paragraphs with synthetic row/cell labels.

Version 40 keeps the version 39 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ruby groups now remain intact when large text blocks are soft-flushed.

Version 39 keeps the version 38 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because image top margins are now clamped to keep full-height images within the
page viewport.

Version 38 keeps the version 37 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because Focus Reading now permits line breaks at visible hyphens and dashes
and hyphenates focus-split words as a whole, changing cached page layout.

Version 37 increases the fixed-size footnote href field from 96 to 256 bytes.
This changes each serialized footnote record from 128 to 288 bytes, so older
section caches must be discarded and rebuilt.

Version 36 keeps the version 35 serialized layout unchanged. It was bumped
because ruby and justified text positioning and CJK line breaking now use
corrected word measurements, so version 35 cached page layouts no longer match.

Version 35 adds a header offset and a `uint32_t` entry per page for the
visible-text offset LUT. The other section LUTs remain unchanged.

Version 34 is binary-identical to version 33. The version was bumped because
word-gap suppression was narrowed to tokens glued together in the source: v33
dropped the gap between any two words meeting at a CJK break opportunity, which
collapsed the spaces between Hangul words, so v33 word positions no longer match
what the layout engine now produces.

Version 30 is binary-identical to version 29. The version was bumped because
Arabic contextual shaping changed text measurement (`getTextAdvanceX` now
measures the shaped visual text), so word positions cached by v29 no longer
match what `drawText` renders.

Version 28 introduced serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough,
superscript, and subscript. The format also includes:

- cache-busting fields for paragraph alignment, hyphenation, embedded CSS,
  image rendering mode, and Focus Reading
- page offset LUT
- per-page visible-text offset LUT (zero-based Unicode codepoints in `<body>`)
- anchor-to-page map for fragment and footnote navigation
- paragraph and list-item LUTs retained for navigation and legacy sync fallback
- optional per-word Focus Reading split metadata
- per-page footnote entries
- serialized word style bits for underline, strikethrough, superscript, and
  subscript
- flat TextBlock word storage (v29): per-word arrays plus one shared
  NUL-terminated text blob, replacing v28's length-prefixed word strings. The
  on-disk order mirrors the in-RAM arena so the firmware reads a whole block
  payload with a single allocation and a single SD read

## CLX1 — library index (`.crosspoint/library.idx`)

Written by `lib/LibraryIndex/LibraryBuilder.cpp`, read by `LibraryIndexFile`. One
file describing every book on the card, so the shelf can sort and search
thousands of titles without opening any of them.

Format version 2. An index written by another version fails validation on open
and is rebuilt; that is the entire migration mechanism.

### Layout

| Section | Offset | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| Header | 0 | 64 bytes, `ClixHeader` |
| Folders | `folderStart` | length-prefixed paths, one per folder |
| Records | `recordStart` | `bookCount` × 128-byte `ClixRecord` |
| Permutations | `permStart` | `bookCount` u16 author order, then `bookCount` u16 arrival order |
| Name blob | `nameStart` | per record: path hash, name, canonical author, title, source author (see below) |

The arrival permutation runs oldest first, keyed by the record's FAT
modification time (when the file landed on the card); `firstSeen` — the
build-assigned discovery counter — breaks ties and carries books whose
filesystem reports no time. Fold version 3 introduced the timestamp key; a
fold bump rebuilds ranks while preserving `firstSeen`.
Fold version 4 preserves leading articles in title sort and search keys.

Sections are 512-byte aligned so each starts on an SD block boundary.

### Records are exactly 128 bytes

A fixed stride is what lets the reader seek straight to record *n* without an
offset table, and read a screenful in one 4 KB block. `static_assert` enforces it.

Each record carries `fold[96]`, the title normalised for search and sorting —
accents stripped, case dropped, leading articles preserved — and `authorKey[12]`,
the author's words folded and sorted so that "Victor Hugo" and "Hugo Victor" group as
one person. `authorKey` is a GROUPING key, not an ordering one: the shelf orders by
surname, derived separately from the display name.

The byte before the folded title records metadata extraction status: not
attempted, extracted, or failed. The final four bytes contain the packed FAT
modification date and time returned by SdFat. A zero timestamp is not trusted.
These fields occupy the alignment and reserved bytes from version 1, so the
record remains exactly 128 bytes.

The header records whether EPUB metadata extraction was enabled for the build.
This prevents a metadata-disabled rebuild from making filename fallbacks look
fresh to a later metadata-enabled build.

### The name blob

Per record, at `nameStart + nameOff`:

```text
[u64 pathHash]    FNV-1a fingerprint of the complete path
[nameLen bytes]  filename, without the directory
[u8][author]     display author, one spelling chosen per authorKey across the library
[u8][title]      the book's own title, or length 0 if it never gave one
[u8][source]     cleaned author spelling before the library-wide spelling vote
```

The filename must stay the first textual field and stay the filename: `readPath`
rebuilds a book's path from it, so writing the display title there makes the book
impossible to open. That was a real defect, and it is why title has its own field.

The source author is separate from the displayed canonical author so a later
rebuild can repeat the spelling vote after books are added or removed. Existing
display reads still stop at the author or title fields and retain their offsets.

### Freshness and unchanged rebuilds

Reconciliation treats the persisted 64-bit complete-path fingerprint as the
book identity. Metadata is reused only when the fingerprint, size, nonzero FAT
timestamp, fold version, metadata mode, and expected extraction status agree.
EPUBs with a zero timestamp or a previous extraction failure are parsed again.

If every current record reuses metadata, the old and new counts agree, and no
unreadable entry was seen, the staging files are discarded and the live index is
left byte-for-byte unchanged. A normal rebuild action is therefore a freshness
check, not a forced metadata reread.

### Header flags

`RANKS_DEGRADED` says one or more orders fell back to walk order because a
checked sort allocation failed. Title and author each use a phase-local
`SortKey[bookCount]` allocation (14 bytes per book, 57,344 bytes at the 4,096-book
format ceiling); the first array is released before the second is requested.
Sorting is therefore best effort through the full format limit rather than
being disabled at an arbitrary library size.

`DEDUP_DEGRADED` says a directory exceeded the fixed 1024-entry duplicate-key
buffer, or that its fallible 8 KiB allocation failed. The walk still indexes
every enumerated book; it only stops remembering additional identities for
duplicate-dirent detection, so a damaged FAT may expose duplicates but cannot
make a real book disappear.

`selfSize` is the expected file size. Comparing it against the real one is a free
truncation guard: a build cut short by a power failure cannot pass.

## Crossword

The Crossword app (`src/activities/apps/Crossword*`, the pure half in `lib/Crossword`) reads puzzles from flash and
from the SD card, and keeps its own small text files. Every text format below is parsed by a pure codec with host
tests (`test/crossword`); anything that does not parse and validate completely is treated as missing.

### Built-in puzzle text (`scripts/crossword/builtin.txt`)

The source of the built-in puzzles. `scripts/crossword/gen_builtin.py` validates it and generates
`lib/Crossword/CwBuiltinData.cpp`, which holds each puzzle's block of this file (comments and blank lines left out);
the firmware parses a block with the same parser the host tests run on every built-in (`cw::parseTextPuzzle`).

```
# a comment: '#' then a space (or '#' alone); blank lines are ignored
=== mini-001 | Mini 1
##MOO
STORM
LANCE
OCEAN
TOY##
A 1 Sound from a dairy cow
...
D 5 Folded tortilla with a filling
```

- `=== <id> | <title>`: the id is `[a-z0-9-]{1,24}`, unique; the title 1..48 bytes.
- Comments: a line that is exactly `#`, or `#` followed by a space, is a comment, anywhere in the file; a line of
  spaces and tabs only is blank and ignored. **Every other line is read as it stands**, so a line made only of
  `A`-`Z` and `#` is a grid row wherever it appears: a `#####` divider or `#NOTE` inside a block is a row (it breaks
  the grid, or is refused after the clues), and `#note` (no space) is refused. Write every comment as `# text`. The
  generator and the firmware's parser apply this same rule, and a grid row never holds a space, so the two never meet.
- Then the grid: rows of equal width, 3..15 squares a side, `A`-`Z` for a white square's answer and `#` for a
  block.
- Then one `A <number> <clue>` line per Across entry and one `D <number> <clue>` per Down entry. Numbers follow the
  standard rule: row by row, a white square gets the next number when it starts an Across run (no white square to
  its left, one to its right) or a Down run (the same above and below); runs are 2 squares or more. Every run has
  exactly one clue.
- A puzzle's identity is `fnv` = FNV-1a 32 over `"<w>x<h>:"` followed by the solution rows (blocks as `#`).

### Card puzzles (`/Puzzles/Crossword/`)

```
/Puzzles/Crossword/*.ipuz, *.puz          the collection "On the card"
/Puzzles/Crossword/<pack>/*.ipuz, *.puz   one collection per folder, named after it (one level only)
```

Extensions are matched without regard to case; dot files and dot folders are ignored, and so is any other file. At
most 32 pack folders and 200 files a folder are listed; an `.ipuz` file may be up to 128 KB, a `.puz` up to 64 KB.
A puzzle's source key is `builtin:<id>` or its full card path (at most 96 bytes; longer paths are not listed).

- **ipuz** (ipuz is a trademark of Puzzazz, Inc., used with permission): JSON, streamed with a filter.
  `kind` must hold a string starting `http://ipuz.org/crossword`; `dimensions` `{width, height}`; `puzzle` rows of
  cells (a number, `0` or the file's `empty` value for a white square, `#` or the file's `block` value for a block,
  `null` for an omitted square = a block, or `{cell, style}`; `style.shapebg: "circle"` = a circled square, any
  `barred` style = refused); `solution` is required, one letter A-Z a square (case folded); `clues` `Across` / `Down`
  (a key may be `Across:<label>`), each clue a string, a `[number, text]` pair or `{number, clue}`; `title`,
  `author`, `copyright`. When the file numbers its squares, the numbers must match the rule above. HTML in titles
  and clues is stripped and its entities decoded.
- **puz** (Across Lite, binary, little-endian): `ACROSS&DOWN\0` at 0x02, width 0x2C, height 0x2D, clue count 0x2E,
  puzzle type 0x30 (0x0401 diagramless: refused), scrambled state 0x32 (non-zero: refused as locked); then the
  solution grid (`.` = block), the player grid (ignored), and NUL-terminated title, author, copyright, the clues in
  numbering order (Across first for a shared number) and notes. Text is ISO-8859-1 below version `2.0` and UTF-8 from
  it. Extensions: `GEXT` bit 0x80 = circled; a `GRBS` with any non-zero square = rebus, refused. Checksums are
  counted (logged) but never required.
- Refused files show a reason in the picker: bigger than 15 x 15, rebus, locked, diagramless, barred, no solution,
  not a crossword, damaged, too many clues (over 100 entries or 16 KB of clue text), numbering that does not match,
  clues that do not match the grid. A clue longer than 400 bytes is cut, not refused.
- Clue text is cleaned to UTF-8 with single spaces: typographic quotes, dashes and the ellipsis become ASCII, and any
  other character the UI fonts cannot draw becomes `?`.

### Save files (`/.crosspoint/crossword/`)

Written tmp -> remove -> rename (a cut between the last two reads as "no save"), except the solved list, which is
appended to.

`prefs.dat`:

```
CP1
current <source key> | -
skip 0|1
collection builtin | card | pack:<folder> | -
seq <u32>
end
```

`current` is the puzzle being played, `skip` the Skip filled squares option, `collection` the picker's last
collection, `seq` the last progress sequence number handed out.

`progress/<fnv8hex>.dat`, one per puzzle (its identity in lower-case hex):

```
CW1
key <source key>
fnv <8 hex digits>
size <w> <h>
cursor <row> <col> <A|D>
elapsed <seconds>
counts <checks> <reveals>
solved 0|1
seq <u32>
row <w characters: '.' empty, A-Z>                 (h lines; a block holds '#')
flags <w characters: '.' none, 'w' wrong, 'r' revealed>   (h lines)
end
```

When a puzzle opens, its source is parsed again and the progress must match it (fnv, size, blocks, revealed squares
holding their answers, the cursor on a white square); otherwise the puzzle starts fresh. At most 40 progress files are
kept: past that, the one with the lowest `seq` that is not the current puzzle is deleted (`seq` is set each time a
puzzle is opened).

`solved.dat`, one line per solved puzzle, oldest first, at most 2000 (the oldest are dropped when the list is
rewritten). A built-in counts as solved only when its key and its fnv both match a line, so an id given new content is
unsolved again. Card files are marked by key alone (the picker does not parse them), so a new puzzle on the card needs
a new file name:

```
<fnv8hex> <source key>
```
